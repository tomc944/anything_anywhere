          <h1>HOW TO ORDER</h1>
          <br/>
          <p>
            For more than 10 years now I have conducted business here by <b>email negotiation</b> rather than "secure commerce."  As we have seen recently, "secure commerce" is not exactly secure, just convenient.  Here we are trading convenience for human interaction, which I consider the best security.  You and I will negotiate until we are satisfied and only then will I process the order.
            You can cut and paste the text description of whatever you&#39;re interested in, including reference number (if any) and price, into your email. If you want more than one of something, put that information next to the item.  I will personally get back in touch with you regarding what&#39;s available, shipping costs, total bill, method of payment, etc.  Reply time will be variable, as befits a family guy with way too much to do, but I&#39;ll constantly do the best I can.

          <h3>NOTES FOR CLIENTS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE USA</h3>
          <p>
            1. <b>Paying cash</b>: USA banknotes that are torn or have small pieces missing ARE acceptable as payment.  I also accept payment in any convertible currency.
          </p>
            2. <b>IF YOU EXPERIENCE A QUERY OF SOME KIND FROM CUSTOMS DO NOT REFUSE THE PACKAGE!</b>
          Typically, if they open the parcel for whatever reason, they will not find a packing list or invoice.  I do not include such unless YOU have asked me to.  When presented with the query <b>YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY</b>.  I will prepare and fax a statement either to you or to them directly.  That action should take care of things.  If it doesn’t I will keep trying.  The basic point is that you should not deal with them alone.  I should be in on the process.  So when that kind of thing happens <b>GET IN TOUCH!</b>

            <br/>
            <div className="info-terms">
              <ol>
                <li>Everything guaranteed genuine &/or as described. If it is a repro or altered it will be so described.  If not, send it back. Lifetime return privilege on items sold as genuine that turn out to be fake or that were repaired and not so described.  (That's my lifetime.  Don't ask my heirs to fix something for you 50 years from now!)</li>
                <li>RETURNS: No-hassle return in reasonable time, no questions asked.  If return is for my error I will refund part or all of your return postage depending on how many bells & whistles you add to the basic postage cost of the return.  Ask me if you have questions.  Returns deemed to be absurd due to low value or ridiculous reason may result in termination of the business relationship without notice.  (I write this early in 2003 because it has happened several times recently.  If you don't know the parameters of quality, authenticity, pricing, etc. of the thing you're buying ask me and I'll be more than happy to tell you what I think and what I know.  But if you don't and you assume I'm trying to cheat you somehow I'll get all huffy inside and while I'm smilingly refunding your money I'll also be crossing you off my list.  Life is too short for both of us.)</li>
                <li>When you return something either use the "cheapest or most reasonable" method or ask my advice.  If the reason for your return is because I made a mistake I will refund your shipping costs, but only the "cheapest or most reasonable method."  Example: as I write I have on my desk a return.  My mistake.  Parcel weighs about 5 ounces, insured for $200, in a flat rate priority envelope, with delivery confirmation.  Items are worth $56.00.  Postage paid was $9.25.  I would have sent it as a first class package, insured for $100, no delivery confirmation, total $3.86.  I will round upward and refund $4.00.  Post office likes to encourage unnecessary "services."  Do not be taken in.  I will pay for my mistakes.  You will pay for yours.  Talk to me.</li>
                <li>PAYMENT WITH ORDER.  I accept check, money order, cash, credit card (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, Diners Club(!)), paypal, etc.  I also accept foreign currency by prearrangement (rates vary depending on the currency).  Wire transfers are possible, but carry extra fees that make it a silly method for amounts under $1000.00.  Contact me by email to make arrangements. reisbiz@earthlink.net</li>
                <li>REFUND if sold out (human error in inventory entry, etc.) or for return.  Form of refund is at my option.  This means that if you paid by credit card you MAY get a refund by check.  This is because credit card transactions carry fees in both directions, at least mine do.  If I&#39;m going to pay 3.5% + $0.35 each way I may opt to write you a check instead.  Sorry for possible inconvenience.  Gotta trim those costs.  And if you are a regular customer you may get a store credit for the assumed next order, always cashable should you so prefer.</li>
                <li>You pay the invoiced shipping costs.  Shipping costs are based on 1) actual shipping costs & 2) credit card processing costs (we split the cost, which averages 3+%).  Shipping in USA is usually by insured mail ($3.50 minimum).  Overseas methods vary and will be agreed on in advance.</li>
                <li>THERE IS NO INDEMNITY FOR SHIPMENTS OUTSIDE THE USA THAT DON'T ARRIVE.  I ship several hundred parcels overseas every year.  Maybe 3-5 get lost, but registered shipments will recover no more than $45.00, depending on what was written on the customs form.  Overseas shipments are AT THE BUYER'S RISK.  Sorry.  The sole exception is if I ship by parcel post with insurance, in which case the customs sticker must reflect accurate value for those of you who suffer under a VAT or a duty.  "Parcel post" designation will typically double or triple the shipping costs.  IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CUSTOMS CONTACT ME BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!</li>
                <li>NC state sales tax is 6.25% and will be added to all orders shipped to NC addresses.</li>
                <li>You are welcome to ask for a discount and/or make counteroffers.  I may or may not grant the discount or accept your offer.  If I don't this time I might next time, so by all means keep asking.  BUT:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Asking for a price reduction will ALWAYS increase my response time while I think about it</li>
                  <li>Reductions will pretty much never happen for transactions of less than $100.00, for gold, for large orders of cheap stuff (e.g.: 150 different items @ $0.50 each)</li>
                  <li>In the low dollar / high precious metal price situation that obtains from late 2007 discounts become less likely and smaller, the opposite in fact, some prices may rise without prior notice.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>WANTLISTS - I do not have an automated system that goes "beep" when I get something someone wanted.  Instead, you can do 2 things to maximize your chance of getting something:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Get on the email announcement list by asking to be on it,</li>
                  <li>call or email me in the 3rd week of every month to ask me about that specific thing you want.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>SECURITY CONSIDERATION (mine) - I like to develop relationships of trust.  Multiple repeat customers may experience ship-and-bill orders rather than pay-in-advance.  If this is the case with you I may, at any time, resume the pay-in-advance procedure.  The most likely reason will be that you have made an order much larger than usual, but any reason will do, and I "reserve the right" absolutely.  This policy may be applied even to customers that have had years of interaction with me.  Nothing personal.  Just business.</li>

                  <b>CREDIT CARD SECURITY</b> - Doing a credit card order with a new person is a shot in the dark on both sides.  What you see is someone hiding behind a website, not necessarily who I say I am, and I see someone in possession of a credit card # that I can verify is "good" but I can't verify that the person I'm dealing with is the authorized user.  If I charge an account and the charge is contested by the cardholder my account is debited and there is nothing I can do.  That has happened to me before, and I believe the big merchandisers think they're lucky if they only get single digit percentages of credit card fraud.  But the dealers are always left holding the bag, and naturally we're perturbed.
                  I can show you my Raleigh Business License if you want, to prove who I am, and I suppose you could send me a copy of a photo id to match the name on your imaged credit card if you wanted to.  The traditional thing us mailorder people do with new "blind" credit card orders is to process them and then wait to ship until the end of the billing period (a month).  That's why when you buy the electric can opener that also mows your lawn and rocks your baby to sleep from the TV they tell you it may take up to 6 weeks for delivery.  I guarantee you the delay is not due to the crush of business.
                  So, unless you undertake heroic measures to reveal yourself to me, that's what will happen if your first order is a credit card order: it may take a couple of weeks to get your parcel.  But after we get to know each other things will speed up considerably.
                  Cybernetic security does not deal with this issue.  It exists purely for the shopping and processing convenience of volume businesses, so the web operator never has to talk with the customer.  I foresee the time when this site is forced by inexorable finincial considerations to adopt what will eventually be a more "secure" setup than my current approach of email-until-a-plan-emerges that is working so well here at the moment.  But I plan to remain PERSONALLY available to you, my beloved customers, without whom I'd have to do something else, into the distant future.

                  HOW TO ORDER USING A CREDIT CARD
                  <ol>
                    <li>Email me what you want.  I will send you back a pro forma order showing what's available and how much it will cost, including shipping costs, and will indicate shipping options if applicable.</li>
                    <li>Email me again to confirm.  If you want to pay by credit card you can make totally reasonable security by sending me the first two sets of numbers in one email and the second batch and exp. date in a second email.  Or you can be creative and erudite and send me your card # written out in some code that you devise and send me the key for (like 1=a, etc. or 1=2, etc.) or in some language other than english (I can handle all Romance & Germanic languages, I think, and Chinese, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Hindi, Russian and probably most Slavic languages, Hungarian, and possibly others.  If I'm not sure I'll ask you.  Cute?  But it works.</li>

Parcels shipped insured in USA, registered ($9.50) air (+$1.00/28g) elsewhere unless you instruct otherwise.  No refund if lost & you told me not to insure. OVERSEAS SHIPMENTS ARE AT BUYER'S RISK AND NO REFUND WILL BE MADE FOR ITEMS LOST IN TRANSIT.  Over the years I have lost several thousands of $$ worth of material sent overseas, and nothing can ever be done.  The fault is hard impossible to pin down, even with a registered parcel.  Fortunately it doesn't happen very often.  The worst countries I've shipped to, as far as loss and tampering, are Russia and India, but I have had losses to UK and Switzerland as well.  In almost every case, when making inquiries, the customs service of the offending country signs the proper forms and that's the end of it.  Total loss.  Or, alternatively, a year or two later, I get back a maximum of about $40.00.  So, sorry, your risk.</li>
                  <li>PLEASE MENTION ALTERNATE CHOICES, WHETHER SAME ITEM IS ACCEPTABLE IN BETTER OR WORSE GRADE, DIFFERENT DATE,  ETC.  MOST THINGS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.  A FEW TRUSTING SOULS HAVE LET ME CHOOSE THEIR ALTERNATES FOR THEM. NONE HAVE COMPLAINED.  MOST HAVE REPEATED.</li>
                  <li>NC residents: 7.5% sales tax.</li>
                  <li>BUY or BID: Bids welcome without time limit.  At a show, maybe you offer less than asking price & dealer says come back later.  After decent interval dealer says you can have it,  or makes counteroffer, or maybe it sold, too bad. Minimum bid is $5.00.</li>
                  <li>DICKERING (i.e. negotiation).  Yes, of course.  But dickers, like bids, are subject to prior cash sale until the package is mailed.  Cash sale always preempts a dicker.  Business.  So don&#39;t get mad at me if this happens.</li>

                <p>This is <b>personal opinion</b> only, an appropriate perspective in the field of numismatics, where opinion, unencumbered by any facts other than the existence of the specimen, is often all there is in the discussion.  The author has found himself fixated on numismata for half of his childhood and all of his adult life.  He has attempted to wrest profit from his obsession for about 35 years.  That&#39;s where his opinions come from.</p>
                <br/>

                <ol>
                   <li>WHY COLLECT?
                     <br/>
                    Don't know.  I remember being acquisitive toward small, shiny round, flat discs before I could read.  I started out with washers and tiddly winks.  55 odd years later I notice that every class of object has it's aficionados and that each is served by a market.  I don&#39;t know why for some people it is coins rather than cars or chocolate moulds. All I know is that certain people find themselves attracted to money as a collectible, and want to spend time and substance on the objects of their desire.
                    If you've collected something for a while you've undoubtedly noticed that most people are not collectors and don't care about your collection.  If your collection has gotten to the point that you've spent significant time and money on it you will have met a few people who think your devotion to your hobby is nuts.  Relations occasionally get strained.  You can kick back in the sure knowledge that for at least the past century the objects you collect have increased in value, and that during that period a  well-put-together collection has repaid both the time and the capital outlay involved in it&#39;s assembly.
                    Coins, etc. are treated with in a variety of manners ranging from their conversion into jewelry to involved scientific study for the purposes of historical reconstruction.  Money having been part of the world scene for 2500 years, the collectors of money-objects develop automatically a deeper understanding of the place of economics in human history than do those who merely get and spend the stuff.
                   </li>

                   <br/>

                   <li>WHAT IS COLLECTABLE?
                     <br/>
                     Metal coins are the mainstay of most numismatic collections. These were first made about between 2700-3000 years ago, with either China (probably) or Turkey being the home of the first issues.  A subset of metal coins are bullion ingots, such as the American Eagles, Chinese pandas, South Indian fanams, etc., made primarily for the convenience of hoarders.  Next most popular field is banknotes, which have been in regular use since the 18th century, and whose at-the-moment unobtainable earliest issues date from 500+ years before that.  Plenty of cheap banknotes are available to make a nice collection.  Token collectors are a growing cohort.  Many types of these unofficial coins are readily available.
                     Objects other than metal discs and pieces of paper have been used as money, and the collection of "Odd-and-Curious" or "Primitive" or "Traditional" money objects is the passion of a small and practically religiously dedicated group of collectors.  The O&C people sometimes end up being world class experts in some aspect of a culture whose valuable objects they have collected, performing first class anthropological work.
                     Commemorative medals also form a large and coherent field of study, but their size makes them a bit harder to deal, and therefor to come by.  Most dealers will have a couple of medals in stock.  Very few will have hundreds lying around.  They&#39;re too big.
                     A bit farther afield, but still intimately related to the core idea of money, are award medals, (which are made the same way as coins), and by extension various other insigniae from military ranks to uniform buttons to license tags.  On the paper side of "exonumia" are checks, chits and "good-fors," bond and share certificates, etc.  And of late we have collectible plastic: credit and ATM cards, phone cards, etc. Finally, you will find that "coin-dealers" have made a market niche for themselves in other collectible fields: fossils (small ancient objects), sports cards (general size and shape of banknotes), and as bullion dealers.
                     In numismatics, as in every other merchandise line, there are "regular" items and "specials."  In numismatics the regulars are the coins, etc. issued to general circulation.  The specials come in these categories:
                         1.  Commemorative issues.  Most, but not all, are sold by the issuing government as a collectible for more than their face value,
                         2.  Nummiae, commemorative or not, done up by the government in a fancy package and sold as a collectible for more than its face value,
                         3.  Manufacturing mistakes of various kinds.
                     It is the author&#39;s opinion that many governments have been turning out too many frothy concoctions for collectors of late.  100 ounce gold coins, forsooth!
                     And it turns out often that the secondary market, where you go to sell your coins when you get tired of them, will not support the government&#39;s price on those coins, and the original purchaser loses money.  Example: with a few exceptions, every modern USA commemorative dollar is easily available from dealers at up to 60% off its issue price.  One of the jackpot coins goes for about 2x issue, the other about 125%.
                     Just my opinion.

                   <br/>

                   <li>IDENTIFICATION
                     <br/>

                     Some of what you can collect is easy to identify, but a lot of it isn't.  How do you decide if it's a good deal (if you&#39;re going to buy it) or worth anything (if you found it)?  You need references.  For the field of "modern world coins" the standard reference in English is The Standard Catalog of World Coins, Colin Bruce II, ed., Krause-Mishler (KM) Publications.  Currently there are five volumes covering the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.  Revised editions are published frequently (perhaps more frequently than necessary!)  They have in them about 99% of  the 20th century coins declining to perhaps 50% of the 17th century, with suggested prices in several grades of preservation, not all of which necessarily exist .  Prices range from reasonabaly accurate to guess to hopefully optimistic, with some extremely undervalued keys.  Most people use them.
                    For paper money the core reference is also by KM: The Standard Catalog of World Paper Money, (3 volumes).
                     These catalogs give each item a unique number, and the numbers are used by most dealers to identify their offerings.  If you don't have these catalogs you'll have a problem reading many dealer lists, mine for instance.
                     Many specialized catalogs are available by country and time period.  Thousands.  I have about 100 books in my reference library, and I use about 20 of them all the time.  A numismatic cliche with which I wholeheartedly agree: "Buy the book before you buy the coin."

                      <p>Very Good (VG).  All of the lettering will be visible, though some may be quite worn.  There will be more internal detail in the major design elements, and some fine detail may be present in the deeper spots.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Fine (F).  The rim is complete, and there is some detail on the highest spots.  In England they sometimes call something "good fine" (gF) to describe a mid-grade.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Very Fine (VF).  Most of the fine detail is visible, but there is wear on the highest points.  Coins in this grade have some wear all over, and lack the luster of higher grade coins.  "gVF" is used by Anglodites and Anglophiles.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Extremely Fine (EF or XF).  There will be wear on only the highest points of the design.  The coin will have some, but not all, of its original luster (original sheen).</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>About Uncirculated (AU).  There will be only slight wear on the high spots or slight scuffing of the fields.  The coin will have almost full luster.  The wear may be so slight that you will have to play with the light or use a magnifying glass to see it.  A lot of AU coins are passed as Unc by scuzzball dealers.  English equivalent: gXF.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Uncirculated (Unc - pronounced "unk").  There is no wear.  No matter how carefully you examine the coin you will not see any.  There may, however, be a few small marks caused by the coin hitting other coins after it was ejected from the minting machine.  These are called bag marks.  And there can be toning.  In some cases you will find a bronze coin completely toned to dark brown described as "toned Unc." Not by me.  An Unc coin should have some luster, at least a trace.  And you'd better to be able to explain where the rest of the luster went. You'll also find silver coins with so much toning you can hardly grade them.</p>
                      <br/>
                      Proof (PF).  These are specially made coins.  The blanks on which they are struck are polished, and the dies used to strike them are specially treated.  To make a sharper impression, proofs are struck several times.  The result is a coin with mirror fields and (usually) frosted devices.  Modern proof coins are usually put in fancy packages and sold by the mint to collectors for more than their face value.
                      <p>Modifiers.  Scratches, nicks, rim bruises are detractors and should be taken into consideration.  It is appropriate to mention hairlines and fingerprints if the coin is proof or Unc.  Heavy toning should be mentioned.  Jewelry mounts or spots indicating removal of same, holes, heavy polishing, etc. are considered damage and should significantly lower the price.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Cleaning coins with chemicals works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.  When it's done well and luck is with you you end up with a significantly nicer coin.  But the road you&#39;ll follow will be littered with the mangled corpses of the coins you destroyed on your road to that level of expertise.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Caveat:  Some coins are not well struck.  Other coins are made with worn dies.  This is common in coins made before the middle of the 19th century, and still occurs today.  Worn hubs were used to make the dies for USA coins of the 1970s, and the 1993 Azerbaijan aluminum coins are so crude that many come from the mint looking "VF."  You have to take this into consideration when grading these coins, thus dealers may use phrases like "VF for type," which means the coin looks like it&#39;s VG.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Numerical grades.  30 years ago it was considered sufficient that a coin be merely uncirculated.  Things are different today.  There is now a numerical grading system that is used for expensive, high grade coins.  In this new system, AU is called AU-55, and Unc is called MS (for mint state), with numbers ranging from MS-60 (which dealers will often call "commercial Unc") up to MS-70 (absolutely perfect and completely unbelievable).  The difference in value can be dramatic.  A given Franklin half dollar in MS-60 might sell for around $10.00, but the same coin in MS-65 may go for $100.00, and in MS-70 it could approach $1000.00.  Naturally there is a lot of disagreement when a good coin is given a high grade number.  People can loose a fortune on a bad day.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Slabs.  These for hire, prestige professional grading services have sprung up of late.  You send your coin to them with a hefty fee and they send back your coin in a fancy plastic holder with their opinion of its grade.  It is important to bear in mind when looking at such coins that grading is purely subjective personal opinion, even if hidden behind a faceless "board of graders."  You need to look at the coin itself, not the holder it comes in, and make your own decision that it is or is not as advertised.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <h4><b>PAPER</b></h4>
                      <p>Unc - Absolutely no wear, no folds, no bent corners, no dirt, no nothing.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>AU - One soft fold or wrinkle or bent corner.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>XF - Two soft folds or one hard fold or one small smudge.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>VF - Up to 4 hard folds, bit of dirt.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>F  - Plenty of folds, wear, dirt, but no holes or breaks.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>VG - Lots of wear up to and including breaks and holes.  Usually limp.  An XF note with small tear will  usually be priced as VG.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>G  - The whole note is there, but significant damage.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>aG - Can have a piece missing.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>poor - Barely identifiable rag or piece</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>Modifiers - A pair of staple holes or paper clip rust mark should be mentioned and will usually drop the price to the next lower grade. Unremovable glue or ink spots are severe detractors and can drop the effective grade 2 or more notches.  Cleaned and/or ironed notes are occasionally found and should be acknowledged by the dealer.  They will drop the grade a notch or more.  Tip the note to the light, hold it up to the light, sniff it, etc.  Paper proofs are special printings and are mostly rare.</p>

                    <li>STORAGE & DISPLAY
                      <br/>
                       <p>Uncirculated and proof coins stop being pristine very quickly if they are handled.  If you want to keep them perfect you need to protect them.  This is how you do it.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>First, handle the coin only by its edges, using clean hands so you don&#39;t get your corrosive sweat all over it.  (A greasy finger on a new penny will produce an unremovable fingerprint within a few weeks.)  Then put the coin into one of four possible containers: a polybag which is then inserted into a paper envelope; a mylar & cardboard sandwich holder; a hard plastic holder; or a plastic tube if you have enough coins to make a roll.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Circulated pocket change does not require this degree of care. While just one rub will drop a coin from Unc to AU, weeks of circulation are needed to get it to XF , months and years to go to VF and F, and decades to get into the VG  range.  Today&#39;s coins are tough.</p>
                       <br/>
                      <p>Today, ready-made storage materials are available.  We have basically three choices:</p>
                      <br/>
                   <p>1. Put the coins in little envelopes or holders in a standard sized box.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>2. Put them in compartmented trays.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>3. Put them in an album.</p>
                   <br/>
                      <p>Boxes provide the simplest method of storing coins.  Your coins will be easy to get to, and you'll be able to fit a lot of them in a small space.  If you want to take your coins to a show or a club meeting you can carry a large number of coins in a closed box.  They won't fall out or slide around.</p>
                      <br/>
                       <p>Special boxes are made for coin collecting.  The standard size box has a 2" x 2" face (5 cm x 5 cm), and comes in various lengths from 9" to 14" (22.9-35.6cm).  This size will accommodate coins a little larger than the old US silver dollar.  For special purposes both larger and smaller size boxes are available.  Cardboard is the material normally used, and although these are adequate for most purposes, heavy duty versions in plastic and metal are also available.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Coins of any value to their owner should not be thrown loose into the box.  They need to be protected against wear, and you, as the curator of your collection, need to do the protecting.  There two kinds of products made for use with standard boxes: envelopes and holders.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Envelopes are available in either paper or plastic.  Paper envelopes are the cheapest, of course, and the easiest to use.  Just put the coin in and fold over the flap.  They come in different colors, and there is plenty of space to write down any notes you might want to make regarding the coin that&#39;s in it.  Their convenience is unmatched when there are a large number of coins to be processed.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>There are two drawbacks to paper envelopes.  You can&#39;t see the coin unless you take it out, and each time you do take it out you&#39;re handling it, which can eventually cause wear and reduce value.  Also, the envelope itself might damage coins of certain metals, because of the sulphur in the paper.  Sulphur will cause silver and copper to tone, and can produce corrosion on the aluminum and zinc which are used in many foreign coins.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>A solution to these problems is to put the coin in little inert plastic sleeves inside the paper envelope.  The sleeves used to be made of cellophane, but now are made of polyethylene (polybags.)  They are a good idea.  There are also some special, chemically impregnated paper strips that are supposed to retard corrosion, but I don&#39;t like them.  They wear out after a while, dissipating the chemical into the air where you can breathe it.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Plastic envelopes are usually called flips.  They come in numerous styles, and are usually made out of soft vinyl or harder mylar.  Some styles have 2 pockets, one for the coin and the other for a little paper insert on which you can write your notes on the coin.  The obvious advantage is that you can see the coin, but there are some drawbacks. The hard ones can break, and the soft ones can release corrosive fumes which can damage the coins inside.  Despite their fragility, hard plastic flips are all right for most purposes.  I do not recommend soft plastic flips.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Holders come in two categories.  One is a foldable cardboard frame, usually 4" x 2" (10cm x 5cm), with two holes punched side by side and a mylar sheet glued over them.  You put the coin on the mylar over one hole, fold the holder in the center, and then seal the edges, either with staples or tape.  Occasionally they come pre-glued, but most of these are inferior products, and should usually be avoided.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>If you're going to staple the holders, try to find a stapler with a "flat" contour anvil rather than a "curved" contour.  Or you could flatten your curved staples with a needle nose plier.  A silver coin in a holder leaning against a staple protruding from the next coin's holder will develop an "iron stain" which may not come out.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>In a nutshell, cardboard holders are a bother.  But they are cheap.  The other kind of holder is made of hard plastic, and comes in two halves, which are either hinged or screwed together.  Some of these hard plastic holders are very good, but they can be expensive and they take up a lot of space.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Trays are the classic storage method, used by museums.  The coins sit in little compartments in these specially made trays, which are then stored in a cabinet.  Fancy trays are made of wood and lined with velvet, but cheaper products are available of molded plastic.  Fancy trays and cabinets are very expensive and use up quite a bit of space, and the cheap trays will break with use.  Also, if you should happen to drop a tray the coins will go flying.  Unless you are a real traditionalist or have special needs you probably will not want to use trays.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Albums are available in two categories.  One has cardboard pages with cut out holes.  These are usually made for a particular series of coins, Roosevelt dimes, for instance.  The cheapest cardboard albums have the holes backed with paper, while more expensive versions have plastic sleeves covering the hole on both sides so that the whole coin can be seen.  These are adequate for forming pocket change collections, but the cardboard will usually cause undesirable toning on perfect coins.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>The other type of album consists of vinyl pages with pockets to fit the standard size holders.  These come ready-made, or you can get pages which fit a three ring looseleaf binder.  Looseleaf binders can be convenient both for storage and display.  The drawbacks include the time and effort required to put the coins in the holders, put the holders in the sleeves, rearrange the coins when you need to, etc.  Also, as mentioned above, vinyl can cause corrosion on certain kinds of coins.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>For paper the equivalent of paper envelopes is - paper envelopes. Usually people use regular gummed or special "glassine" envelopes and put their collection in boxes.  An alternative would be in folders in a file cabinet.  These methods are pretty inefficient for paper money.  Vinyl album pages are available, but vinyl can damage paper as well as coins.  There are various mylar products on the market.  Most are for box storage, and none of them will hurt your notes.  As for bigger items, the bigger they are the harder to store.  Sometimes you have to improvise. Or maybe you can hire me to improvise for you.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>As you can see from this discussion, there are no final answers to the storage problem.  Even old timers can't make up their minds.  But these are the possibilities, and you will have to decide what you want to do, because, if you want to have a collection, you'll have to do something.</p>

                     <br/>

                     <li>THE BUSINESS
                       <br/>
                       <p>Dealers.  Coin collectors are accommodated by a large number of dealers running small operations.  In the USA there are several thousand dealers.  Worldwide there are several thousand more.  In USA coin collecting is relatively less popular than in some other countries.  In Germany, for example, it has been estimated that as much as 20% of the general population has collected coins in the past 5 years.  Here the figure would be in the 2% range.  That&#39;s still a lot of people, and the market, though small in mass terms, is healthy.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Numerous countries have export controls on their current coins and banknotes, antiquities, etc.  Other countries place no limits on the trading of coins.  The commodities peddled by us dealers are often procured by methods which were illegal in the countries of origin, but are legal in countries of sale.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>The numismatic market is essentially unregulated.  This means you should know what you're doing before investing heavily.  There are dealers who will shave a grade to make a profit.  If you can't get a yes-sir-right-away-sir-no-questions-asked-within-a-reasonable-time return policy you should be wary of the dealer with whom you&#39;re dealing.</p>
                       <br/>
                      <p>Prices - Are arrived at by reference to standard catalogs, dealer&#39;s assessment of market conditions (supply/demand), customer perspicacity and stubbornness.</p>
                      <br/>
                       <p>The value of a given item is dependent on three things:</p>
                       <br/>
                           <p>1. Its absolute rarity, or how many are available  (supply),</p>
                           <br/>
                           <p>2. Its desirability, or how many people want it   (demand),</p>
                           <br/>
                           <p>3. It&#39;s condition.</p>
                           <br/>
                       <p>Absolute rarity starts with how many were made, minus the number which have been destroyed for various reasons, or are otherwise not available.  For example, millions of some particular old silver dollar might have been struck.  However, perhaps a large number of them were shipped overseas to China, where they disappeared.  Perhaps another quantity were held by the mint and later melted, to be remade into quarters.  Perhaps, too, the mint machinery was not in top condition that year, and most of the coins are weakly struck, making nice looking pieces of that date hard to find.  Finally, of the coins which were released to circulation, most can be expected to be fairly worn.  Thus, a coin which should have been common is actually scarce.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Desirability depends on how many people want a particular coin relative to how many examples are available.  A coin may be extremely rare, with only a few pieces being available in the entire world, but if no one wants it, the dealer who owns it will keep lowering the price until it sells.</p>
                       <br/>
                       <p>Condition is a critical element in pricing.  A given coin in top condition can be literally thousands of times more valuable than the same coin in low grade.</p>
                       <br/>
                     </li>
                     <br/>

                     <li>INVESTMENT
                       <br/>
                       This is tricky.  Whether it's coins or banknotes or medals or whatever, relatively few pieces will pay back their investment, but those that do will often do so handsomely.  Best general advice I have is to only buy the unquestionable best and preserve it in that condition.  Can't go wrong that way.  Beware of advertised "specials."  The fact of the matter is that the dealers can only sell what they have.  You need to snag a good deal when it comes along, but in general you should be looking for the stuff the dealers don&#39;t have.

                <h3>Grading Policy - How I try to describe states of preservation</h3>

                <p>My core business has revolved around coins, and that sector is where I take my notions about the condition of objects from.  I've discovered, as I attempt to operate in different collectible fields, that much of the nomenclature is similar, but though the words sound the same, they may mean something different.  I believe that I've also noticed that the coin business has the most standardized grading scale of all collectible fields.  For that reason, and from the fact of my long acquaintance with the coin grades, I will tend to use them indiscriminately for all the objects I try to sell to you.  Occasionally this will create misunderstanding, make me look like an idiot, etc.  But what can I do?  I'll just be a fool.  Maybe you'll get a bargain.  Or maybe I&#39;ll (inadvertently, I hope) rip you off.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>In my pre-website days I sold almost entirely by mail order, issuing 16-page paper pricelists more or less monthly.  I still do paper lists.  At this moment sales from the paper lists account for about 10% of my business, with the rest coming from this website.  If you want to get the monthly email announcements or paper lists, or if you want an email version sent specially to you please click here and tell me what you want.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>In the paper medium I would constantly face space limitations, and thus I developed space saving conventions, like calling an XF item with a scratch, a nick, and a spot "VG," and pricing it as such.  Maybe it's not quite accurate, but I usually discount problem items so severely that people don't seem to complain.  Perhaps as more stuff gets posted on this site I&#39;ll get less taciturn.  After all, my limitations here are of time, not space.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Here are the condition designations I usually use, and what they mean to me:</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>For coins, medals, badges, and most other metal and hard objects</h3>

                <p>poor - Identifiable as what it is, with all kinds of possible damage not needing to be described.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>fair - A little better, must have all of its identifying marks (date, etc.), but doesn&#39;t need to have much else.  Most damage would not need to be mentioned, except for things like holes.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>good (G) - All of the basic design is present, and a few of the details.  Light spots, scratches, nicks, etc. may be ignored, but all serious damage will be mentioned.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>very good (VG) - Substantial detail will be present, but there will also be substantial wear all over. Minor damage may be ignored.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>fine (F) - All major detail will be present, all defects will be described.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>very fine (VF) - All detail will be present, with light general wear all over.  All defects described.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>extremely fine (XF) - Wear on the high spots.  There will be traces of the original surface gleaming here and there.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>almost uncirculated (AU) - Just what it says.  Might even fool you until you look at it closely.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>uncirculated (Unc) - Never been used.  Can have toning or fingerprints or spots, all of which will be described, except that copper, brass, and zinc aged over 50 years or so can have up to 25% light tone without my feeling that they need to be described.  Can have bagmarks, which will not be mentioned unless they are, in my opinion, excessive.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>additional modifiers:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>+ - "better than," e.g. F+ is better than F</p>
                <br/>
                <p>about (a) - "not quite," e.g. aF is not quite F</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Then there are some special coin designations</p>
                <br/>
                <p>nice&#60;choice&#60;gem - niceness designations in ascending order.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>brilliant Unc (BU) - A nice Unc with all of the original shine, basically no toning, and approximately no bagmarks.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>gem BU - nicer yet.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>proof - a specially struck piece, usually assumed to be perfect gradewise, but may have defects which must be described. It is entirely possible, though uncommon, to have a proof that objectively grades VF, or even VG.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>And some common coin problem designations:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>scratch (sc) - means you can see it with a 10x lens.  DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN SEE IT WITH A 20x LENS.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>bag marks - small contact marks on uncirculated coins.  Can be nicks, scratches, or rubs.  Must be &#60;2mm and shallow.  As far as the numbers go, bagmarks are allowed up to about MS63.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>edge bumps (ebs) - someone dropped the coin and now there&#39;s a bruise.  The 10x rule applies.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>edge nicks (ens) - little cuts at the edge.  The 10x rule applies.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>spots - only if you can see them with your naked eye.  I'll mention a tiny little spot on an Unc, but would require a bit more egregiosity on a VF or lower.  If the surface of the spot is raised or sunken then it's...</p>
                <br/>
                <p>corrosion (cor) - which is always bad news.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>cleaned (cl) - this includes anything that visibly disturbs the surface.  Any kind of abrasion from wiping, any polishing, any chemical treatment that can be noticed is considered to be cleaning.  The only kind of cleaning that can get by without mention is the unnoticeable kind.  If you can notice it it is bad news, how bad depends on the extent of the "treatment."</p>
                <br/>

                <p>And of course there are the number designations provided by the grading services that produce the "slabbed" coins that form a sector of the market.  I do not specialize in slabbed coins, and generally do not have a great deal of respect for the acumen of the graders, finding that I disagree with them more than half of the time.  But I do sell slabs when they come in.  A number of grade-extending designations have come into use for USA coins: DMPL, etc., and while it is possible to make a lot of money by catching a DMPL that the previous owner has missed, I can't get the energy together to convince someone that the coin I want to sell them is worth $13,000 instead of $250.  In all cases I try to avoid odious puffery, preferring sweet dreams at night to the stomach ache of wondering if someone's going to try to return a five-figure item tomorrow after I&#39;ve already spent the money.  My goal in grading is simple: no returns.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>A note on zinc and tin: I write this after a new customer expressed disappointment with a zinc coin of the 1940s because it was tarnished.  Customer claimed that the tarnish, according to my own published standards, made it only F-VF.  Got my dander up just a bit. Zinc tones in normal air all by itself.  If it was ever taken out of the original roll, or if it came from the bank in a bag it will be tarnished right there in the sealed bag.  You can have a perfect uncirculated zinc coin with the entire surface even gray.  That is actually normal for zinc.  Any luster at all is extraordinary.  Full luster is BU, rare, and in most circumstances worth at least double the regular catalog value for Unc.  Exceptions to the pricing guidelines that I can think of include Peru 1c of the 1960s and possibly Denmark 1, 2, 5 ore, also of the 60s.
                Notwithstanding, I demand at least a trace of luster of my uncirculated zinc coins, otherwise I'll call it AU.  The returned coin is possessed of about 60% luster.  The customers are always right except when they're wrong.  I am pleased to have the coin back in my inventory.
                Tin will develop pimples and crumbling at the edges, which of course spoils the coins.  Sometimes that&#39;s the only way they come though.  Tin coinage is almost exclusively a southeast Asian phenomenon.  Many tin coins of the 19th century and earlier from Malaya, etc. are known only from their contemporary and/or modern counterfeits, often made of a lead alloy.</p>
                <br/>


                <h3>For Paper and More</h3>

                <p>poor - Identifiable, big pieces missing, the rest worn until barely identifiable.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>fair - At least 90% present, but unpleasantly bad, tape repairs, holes, tears, etc. that wouldn&#39;t need to be described for this grade.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>good (G) - 95% there, but can be missing corners, have big tears, can be badly worn, faded, graffiti, etc., not needing to be described.  Repairs of any quality would be described.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>very good (VG) - All there with substantial wear, dirt, etc.  Usually limp, but will not have any missing pieces, and only one or two minor edge tears, or tiny hole in the body at the folds.  Pinholes or staple holes need not be mentioned for this grade.  Any other problems will be described.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>fine (F) - All major detail will be present, all defects will be described. No holes or tears in this grade.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>very fine (VF) - Two or more hard folds that break the surface, minor dirt.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>extremely fine (XF) - Only one hard fold (breaking the surface), traces of dirt perhaps.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>almost uncirculated (AU) - Not more than one light, soft fold, NOT breaking the surface.  Perhaps a bent corner.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>uncirculated (Unc) - Never been used.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Some special paper terms:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>foxing - dark spots or areas due usually to oxidation, therefore, technically, a bit of burn.  In pricing terms, foxing usually knocks it down a grade.  Bad foxing leads to crumbly fragility.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>proof - in paper, a special printing rather than a pseudo-grade.</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>Ironed Notes</h3>
                <p>This has been a fairly common practice in various locales over the years.  To me an ironed note is usually a VF pretending it's an AU, so I'll just call it a VF. Generally speaking I'm not going to bother to mention it.  Usually it doesn't "hurt" the note I don't think, not as long as we don't pretend it's Unc.  Of course if the item has charisma I'll describe in detail.

                Did I leave anything out?  Let me know. And I'm going to assemble a grading set for coins & paper, and if the pictures turn out to be useful I'll post them.  When will I do that?  Don&#39;t know.</p>

                <h3>IDENTIFICATION SERVICE</h3>
                <p>I&#39;ve been in business for 35+ years, interested in coins over 40 years.  I can identify and authenticate most things numismatic.</p>

                <p>1. OFFER: I will identify any coin, token, banknote, or other numismatic object.  “Identify” means I will tell you, at a minimum,  the country, denomination, date of the thing.  I will offer information on metal content, approximate value (whatever that means), commemorative aspects if any, and any other information I might have.  You can try me on other items not numismatic, but no promises.  Cost is $5.00 per item.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>2. EXCLUSIONS: I will not grade and I will not authenticate from pictures or descriptions.  I can give my opinion on those aspects only if you ship me the object for physical inspection.  See below for details.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>3. METHOD:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>A. Either send me a picture or give me a good description.  The best pictures of coins, medals, etc. will be scanner images at 150%, 300 dpi, extra sharpness, taken on a black background (easily produced by leaving the cover off).  White background will tend to produce too much contrast.  The best pictures of banknotes will be on a scanner at 100%, 200 dpi, normal sharpness.  Take pictures of both sides and send as uncompressed jpgs attached to an email.  You can send up to 6 jpgs totalling about 2mgb per email.  You can send me other types of images (camera, etc.) in other formats, but they may not work for various reasons.  DO NOT SEND FAX PICTURES.  THEY DON'T WORK.  And a faxed picture uses up about 30 pages worth of ink.  Annoying.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>B. If you send me a description I want to know as much as possible of the following:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-metal content and/or color</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-size (millimeters preferred to inches) and shape</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-description of the major design elements of both sides</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-the legend on both sides.  If in a foreign alphabet (non-”Roman,” which is the one used for English, etc.) try to figure out what alphabet it is and tell me.  If it is Greek or Russian with a lot of letters similar to Roman then try to “fake it.”</p>
                <br/>
                <p>C. I may ask you more questions</p>
                <br/>
                <p>D. When I am done I will send you one of the following messages:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-I have identified your item(s).  Pay me $x through paypal or authorize credit card charge and I will send you my results, or</p>
                <br/>
                <p>-I’m sorry, I can’t identify your item, you don’t owe me anything.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>E. You will pay me and I will send you my information.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>4. NO REFUNDS for any reason.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>7/1/2007 - So this has been going for a year, and I kept stats.  121 people asked for identifications of 525 things. I provided 13 for free for various reasons, charged and was paid for 422.  The others refused to pay so I didn&#39;t act.  It was kind of funny sometimes - many of the 51 refuseniks had already failed in their google but they would not pay, you know, ANYTHING, to get the answer to their question.  Some of those coins had all the necessary information right there: BRIT. OMN...., REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE..., hammer and sickle.  Makes the world go round.</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>Grading and Authentication</h3>
                <p>You must realize that anything I might say will not have the cachet, though it may have the accuracy, of the big grading services, but my opinion might turn out to be worth something, and I will do work on objects that the agencies will not touch.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <p>A. I must have the object in hand.  You will pay the shipping costs both ways, and I will charge you $5.00 for a grade opinion and $5.00 for an authentication opinion.  If I decide the thing is genuine you will get a signed letter from me giving my conclusions.  The item will be scanned or digitally photographed and that picture will be reproduced on the letter.  That and a couple of bucks will get you a cup of coffee.  Occasionally, however, you might run into someone who will take my word for something, and on that basis will buy something from you that otherwise maybe they would not.  If I think the thing is not genuine I will ask you if you want a signed letter with photo or not.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>B. The turnaround time will usually be short.  If there is a problem that requires research or consultation I&#39;ll let you know.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>C. At the moment I do not have an "application form." I'll make one when the traffic demands.  For now just get in touch and we'll work out the details.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>D. For authentication you will get a "real," "fake," or "I can't tell" from me.  You will not be charged for "I can't tell."  For oriental cast coins a statement including the word "probably" will be billed as a definitive conclusion and will be accompanied by an explanation for the uncertainty and recommendations for further (expensive) research.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>E. For grade you will get a standard "word" grade (very good, extremely fine, etc.).  Detractors will be mentioned.  Split grades will be mentioned, as will grading peculiarities specific to that item, country, type, year, etc. if I know them (such as the fact, on German minors of 1873-89, that unless the little shield on the eagle's breast has some detail the coin is not better than VG no matter how nice the rest of it looks).  So you'll get blather if necessary, but you will not get numbers.  I don&#39;t do numbers.  It will be "uncirculated," not MS60.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>F. All of this stuff will be my opinion only.  I may be wrong.  If I am I will apologize and retract my opinion in writing, but I will not make a refund.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>6/15/2008 - In past year I have written 29 letters as described above.</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>Appraisal</h3>
                <p>I have done a number (more than 6, less than 400) of collection appraisals for collectors or their estate.  The largest was 40,000 items, several were more than 10,000.  I produce a written report, details to be arranged by negotiation, telling you what you wanted to know.  Typically this will be what you have and what it is "worth."  "Value" can be described in terms of relaceablity or potential sales value were one to sell to a dealer.  "Retail" or "market" prices are subject to market forces, and I will be glad to explain why I think an appraisal giving values in these terms is not a good idea.  "Catalog" values are useful in some series, not in others, and I can explain my views on this as well.  I will travel if my expenses are paid.  I charge by the hour, but I work very fast.</p>

                <p>6/15/2008 - I have performed 8 formal appraisals with written reports.  Total over 113,000 items.</p>
