Building Architecture
	- User authentication, admin user has CRUD functionality for coins and auctions
	- Clients can browse coins, search coins, add coins to cart, and purchase coins

Payments
	Options:
		- Automated with Stripe: there is no price negotiation
		- Email payments: price negotiable

Design
	- High res photos of current coins
	- Any desired high resolution images (optional)
	- Logos (optional)
	- http://www.knyew.com/ Obviously too urban, but I like the design of just the header (brand, nav bar, etc.)
	Keeping NY Everywhere —> Anything Anywhere?

Automated auction
	- Users can view current auctions (tab in nav bar)

	- Workflow:
		- Admin sends out mass email to all users, which includes link to current auctions page and can also include a closing auction time or leave that to be decided in the future. 

		- #can make bids only when bid > current_max_bid && bid_time < auction_end_time

		- Admin can send out mass email to notify if the auction close time is adjusted or to set an auction close time if the auction was created without a closing time.

		- Issue: How do they pay after auction ends (workflow)
			- somehow added to each user’s cart? (how)
